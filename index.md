The Center for Rural Empowerment and the Environment (CREE) is an environmental leadership incubator whose mission is to create permanent community leadership for natural resource conservation. We accomplish this through mentoring and supporting talented scientists from the developing world to create local environmental institutions in often challenging, remote, and resource-constrained locations. We work to ensure that conservation and social justice are accomplished simultaneously.
