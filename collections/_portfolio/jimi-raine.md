It’s not often I want to add even more work to my bulging schedule but Jimi is definitely a talent you would want to spend time with. Along with Will Bose I have set up an artist management company to help artists like Jimi who truly deserve a shot at success.

Solo artist Jimi Raine is on a mission to keep British Rock n Roll on the map.

A natural front man with an explosive vocal, he plays guitar and writes all of his own material, “Some people do therapy, some take Prozac, I make rock music..”

Inspired by early Springsteen, The Clash and The Who, Jimi is completing the recording his debut album at Assault and Battery studios, London with multi-award winning Producer Andy Wright and Gavin Goldberg (Jeff Beck, Simple Minds).  The antithesis of manufactured groups with overnight media hype, Jimi and his band will make their mark the old way, one town and one venue at a time..  

Jimi is based in North London, his debut single ‘Rock n Roll Band’ is due to be released on July 7th 2014.  

“One of the best recording voices I’ve ever heard, and the performance ability that dare I say, is up there with a young Springsteen.’  Producer, Andy Wright
