It was a pleasure to help Mercutio make this fabulous record which was recorded by Drew Smith at Assault and Battery and mixed by Gavin Goldberg. Gianluca Cucchiara’s contribution to this record is huge and I am sure my job of overseeing the proceedings would not have given the band such a great result without him.

From their website : “Mercutio are a four piece Rock band based in London.Taking influence from Radiohead, Muse and Porcupine Tree, the guys wrote, recorded and toured together for several years in various bands before forming Mercutio in June 2011. The band earnt their spurs the old way, gigging on the underground and alternative music scene and playing rock venues throughout the UK and across Europe.

Mercutio recorded their debut album at Assault and Battery Studios, London with multi award winning producer Andy Wright (Jeff Beck, Simple Minds). ‘Back to Nowhere’ is mixed by 2014 Brit Award winner Alan Moulder (Arctic Monkeys, Foo Fighters and The Killers) and set for release in the spring of 2014. The band are signed to Independent label Mazepa Records run by co-composer and co-producer Gianluca Cucchiara, and backed by film producer Giovanna Romagnoli (Academy Award winner for Nuovo Cinema Paradiso).”
