1st entry into my lockdown ‘to do’ list was to recover this special record that I co-wrote and produced with the enigmatic singer songwriter Ryan Molloy. To all intents and purposes this is a collection of our demos recorded between 1998 and 2000. I was able to recover the stereo masters from old DAT tapes (digital cassettes) which had been consigned to my attic for at least 18 years. Finding them all was a trip down memory lane but they sound amazingly fresh and modern. My overriding memory of the time was the intensity we applied to our sessions, often working late into the night or the early morning. It’s now available to stream on all platforms.
