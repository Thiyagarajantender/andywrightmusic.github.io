Purdy’s second album ‘Both Sides of the Clown’ picks up where she left off on her acclaimed first album ‘Diamond in the Dust’. Setting our stall out to represent her definitive taste in music from the ‘40s to the ‘60s we created a magical journey of songs recorded with her band in the wonderful British Grove Studios. Alongside the creation of this album, Purdy has been growing her fanbase with her sold out Jazz club ‘Purdy’s Pop Up’ in Henley on Thames and her residency at the famous 606 Club in Chelsea.
