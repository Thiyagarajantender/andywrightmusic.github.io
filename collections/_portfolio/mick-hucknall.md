Mick and I are working together at the moment and the fact that this is our 18th year and 8th album is testament to our success as collaborators. All of our albums have made the top ten (2 number one’s), and Mick continues to sell out arenas the world over. We are currently working on Mick’s 1st solo album which marks an exciting departure in sound from Simply Red. Highlight for me over all the albums would probably have to be Fairground as it was our first no. 1. My personal favourites would be Mellow my Mind from ‘Blue’, ‘Sunrise’ and ‘Fake’ (single version) from ‘Home’.
