I was working with an artist signed to Hugh Goldsmith’s Innocent label when Atomic Kitten had a huge hit with ‘Whole Again’. Hugh asked me to take a look at their follow up single which was to be ‘Eternal Flame’. In the period leading up to this I had worked with Simply Red and the Fugees on ‘Angel’ and Suzannah Hoff (of Bangles fame) on a version of ‘To Sir With Love’, so I was well versed in the stylistic manoeuvre that I employed on my version of the song which was a number one hit for 3 weeks and helped push the album to a new level of sales.
