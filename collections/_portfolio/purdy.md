What began as a songwriting day has become a labour of love for me. Purdy’s debut album is a truly mesmerising debut which transports you into a wild west tinged love story that would find it’s place quite naturally in a Quentin Tarantino movie. There are hints of the 50’s but it is a truly modern sounding record with outstanding performances throughout. I am very proud of this record and hope it gets the exposure needed to make Purdy a global superstar.

She’s currently touring the UK, and supporting Jools Holland at selected dates. Not to be missed…
