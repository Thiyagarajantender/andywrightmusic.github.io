After a fabulous 25 year career of writing and producing albums which bought him 15m sales and a Grammy, I am currently working with Andreas on a forthcoming project. An incredible experience for me and I am really proud of the results so far. I met Andreas at his house to talk about working together and left believing that if nothing else happened I had the privilege of watching him play for me . His experience and calm in the studio brings out the best in me and I hope it is the beginning of a long term friendship and collaboration.
