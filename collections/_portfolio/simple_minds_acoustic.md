Working with Simple Minds is always a pleasure and our collaboration is now well into it’s 5th year and 3rd album.

Attempting acoustic versions of legendary Simple Minds songs was always likely to be difficult given the premise of omitting both keyboards and drums (signature Minds ingredients). The challenge here was carving out a path that was both fulfilling the brief (acoustic), whilst avoiding the cliché of a campfire on the beach approach. It was to prove to be the criteria by which all our collective decisions were evaluated and the resulting offering a huge triumph for the band and in turn Gavin and myself.

Highlights were the percussion sessions with the incredible Cherise Osei and the collaboration with the ridiculously talented Katie Tunstall which gave us both Record of the Week and A-list at BBC Radio 2.

A real winner!
