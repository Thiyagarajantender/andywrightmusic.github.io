A real labour of love made easy by Peter being a fantastic singer and performer. This album was all about Peter’s artistic ambition and the challenge was to create new songs that established him as a writer. He is a co-writer of every song and is now referred to as ‘Singer/Songwriter’ Peter Grant. I am most proud of this. Highlight for me is ‘Dear Friend’ as Peter and I wrote the opening and had to wait nearly two years before Mark Hudson helped us complete it. Brings the hairs up on your arms!
