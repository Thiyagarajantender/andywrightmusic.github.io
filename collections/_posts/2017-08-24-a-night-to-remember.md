As summer rushes along, I just wanted to take a moment to put down some thoughts on the live spectacle we staged last month in Shepherd’s Bush…

The first West London Music Festival turned out to be an inspiring night of music from a group of artists I’ve really come to admire.

Purdy did a sterling job hosting the show – not an easy thing to do – and her set was excellent, and totally suited to the slinky grandeur of the venue.

Shan Smile’s intimate, relaxed style set up a great atmosphere from the off.

Sam Swallow was intense and classy and it was great to see his set of rich and intricate songs get an airing.

Not surprisingly, The STAXS with special guest Mica Paris provided an epic finale – bringing the full force of a 14-strong line-up and powerhouse vocals – the crowd was rocked and the roof quite possibly raised…

Somewhere in all of the fun, we also raised some money for the Nordoff Robins Trust – an organisation I fully endorse. All in all, an evening to truly remember and one I definitely hope we can stage again…
