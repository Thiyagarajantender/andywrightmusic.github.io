Alison Clarkson (Betty Boo) and I have been acquainted for years but it took a chance appearance in Classic Pop magazine three years back (we were both featured) to really bring us together. Deciding it might be a good idea to try writing a song together, we found we enjoyed it so much (and it worked out so well) that the new Betty Boo album ‘Boomerang’ has been the result. Remarkably, it’s the first full Boo LP in thirty years.

The album features guest appearances from the likes of Chuck D, David Gray and Sophie Ellis-Bextor – and includes the singles, ‘Get Me To The Weekend’ and ‘Shining Star’ already released to wide acclaim. The third single, ‘Right By Your Side’ has just completed its fourth week on the Radio 2 playlist.

Boomerang is out in October – we think it’s set to go far – and with even more songs in the pipeline between us, Betty Boo is definitely back.
