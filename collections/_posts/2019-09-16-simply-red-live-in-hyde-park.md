Great to see Simply Red at Radio 2's live 'Festival in a Day' at Hyde Park – playing some of their biggest hits and showcasing the new single 'Thinking of You'. It's a super-funky track from the upcoming album, 'Blue Eyed Soul', that we've been working on with them. A brilliant performance and fantastic to see the single hit Radio 2's A-List – after all these years, still going from strength to strength.
