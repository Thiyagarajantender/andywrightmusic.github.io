As a record producer, the bulk of my time is spent in a studio slaving over a hot desk (so to speak), but the life-blood of good music is in live performance – and I’ve been thinking for a while now that there are too few decent gigs on the west side of town. Wanting to do something about it, I put some time into bringing together some of the fantastic artists I’ve recently been working with, with the idea of hosting a celebration of their amazing music and creativity.

The location I chose for us to stage this, Bush Hall, is an iconic theatre-style venue in Shepherds Bush. It’s been host to some Britain’s most successful artists over the years, people like Adele, Ellie Goulding and many others – and it seems fitting that we should open our event there. Hopefully, there are going to be many more to come.

In addition to celebrating great music, we’re supporting the work of the music charity Nordoff Robbins – and all of the performers are appearing free in respect of this wonderful cause.

We all believe that music has the power to change lives – Nordoff Robbins brings music therapy to many, many people – with a raft of truly enriching and fulfilling experiences.

Tickets are available on the [Bush Hall website](https://www.bushhallmusic.co.uk).

Hope to see you all there.
