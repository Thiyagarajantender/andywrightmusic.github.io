Simple Minds are live ‘In Concert’ for Radio 2 at the Hackney Empire on Thursday. Radio 2 listeners will be given a sneek preview on the Ken Bruce show in the morning

The show is in support of the new **‘Simple Minds Acoustic‘** album and will be live on Radio 2. It’ll also be viewable on the BBC Red Button.

Recording the album with them was such a pleasure, and it’s great to see it enjoying early success. The new version of ‘Promised You a Miracle’ with KT Tunstall has already made ‘Single of the Week’ on Radio 2, as well as hitting the A-list.  And with a UK and European tour lined up for 2017, the band look to be going from strength to strength.

Speaking of radio exposure, it was great to see the up-and-coming Nell Bryden make the Radio 2 B-List for the month.

And with spot plays for new artist Purdy on Jools Holland’s radio show, the music we’re making looks like finding its way well into the world…
