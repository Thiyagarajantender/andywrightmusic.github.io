It’s been such a pleasure and honour to work with legendary singer songwriter Gilbert O’Sullivan on his latest album, ‘Driven,’ which I produced last year at RAK studios, with Gavin engineering and mixing. 

The album features some truly outstanding new material from one of the greatest names in the business. A top 30 record on release, critically acclaimed in both the music press and the national press, (Gilbert calls them the best reviews he’s ever received) the great man’s renaissance continues to gather pace. And with a new tour lined up taking in the UK and Ireland as well as many European dates, it’s wonderful to have him centre stage again - back where he belongs.
