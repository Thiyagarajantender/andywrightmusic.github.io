Intro about the interview, who with, date, what the general topic was

Q.I really loved the 2 releases you produced for Jeff Beck, You Had It Coming & Jeff. I thought they were very inspiring & progressive. Were there any particular artists
or songs at the time that inﬂuenced you on the production?

A. Thanks, they are stand out records for me too in a 25 year career, particularly ʻYou
had it Comingʼ. I was ﬂattered to get the call from Jeffʼs management and after
meeting him was inspired by his desire to create something fresh. I wasnʼt
particularly interested in making records that only appealed to musicians so I
decided on something more beat driven. Artists that inspired me at the time were
Chemical Brothers, Fatboy slim and Leftﬁeld.
