Fantastic to see the Minds latest album enter the UK album chart at number 4 – testament to a brilliant creative process and the band’s undimmed passion in everything they do.

Not only is the album a terrific commercial success, it’s also been the recipient of outstanding reviews from the likes of Mojo magazine and Record Collector - and continues to gain wides exposure through substantial radio support and mainstream TV performances - including a long-awaited first-time appearance on ‘Later…with Jools Holland.’

Making a record during two years of a global pandemic was never going to be easy - but the result has been a triumph. 

You can catch the videos for the first two singles, ‘Vision Thing’ and ‘First You Jump’ here:
