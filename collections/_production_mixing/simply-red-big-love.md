Mick and I are working together again at the moment and the fact that this is our 20th year and 9th album is testament to our success as collaborators. All of our albums have made the top ten (2 number one’s), and Mick continues to sell out arenas the world over. The highlight for me over all the albums would probably have to be Fairground as it was our first no. 1. My personal favourites would be Mellow my Mind from ‘Blue’, ‘Sunrise’ and ‘Fake’ (single version) from ‘Home’.
